### Frinx ODL Distribution

Targeted at end-users and resellers/developers/OEM customers, releases are synchronized to the ODL release schedule.

**Curated and tested** - each release passes through stages of rigorous quality assurance before we make it available to our customers.

**We also add components and modules** that make the Frinx distribution simpler to use and operate compared with other solutions on the market.

Frinx also offers training, customized consulting and development packages to bootstrap, accelerate or implement your ODL and open source based networking projects.

For questions and orders please contact our team at <a href="mailto:info@frinx.io" target="_blank">info@frinx.io</a>.

### FRINX Smart Build Engine

The FRINX Smart Build Engine (SBE) is a ready-to-run package for the entire software development process. It provides full integration between several well-established open-source solutions for source code management and code review, continuous integration, code quality assessment, project management and repository management.

With the SBE, a development team can immediately get the software development process underway, because all the tools have been preconfigured and linked together by FRINX.

Because it’s scalable to very large projects, it makes it much easier to take a large open source project such as OpenDaylight and fork a new version.

Please see our introductory video [here][1] For full instructions on using the SBE see our [guide][2]
